Adams is a Chilean engineering physicist and doctoral candidate in biophysics with experience in statistical physics of complex systems. His current work is focused on analysis and image processing of time-resolved X-ray diffraction/scattering data from synchrotron and XFEL experiments on biomolecules. His research interest is related to understanding the energy converting machinery of the cell through molecular dynamics simulations on the membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase of the respiratory chain.

> Photosynthetic reaction centres harvest the energy content of sunlight by transporting electrons across an energy-transducing biological membrane. Here we use time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography1 using an X-ray free-electron laser2 to observe light-induced structural changes in the photosynthetic reaction centre of Blastochloris viridis on a timescale of picoseconds. Structural perturbations first occur at the special pair of chlorophyll molecules of the photosynthetic reaction centre that are photo-oxidized by light. Electron transfer to the menaquinone acceptor on the opposite side of the membrane induces a movement of this cofactor together with lower amplitude protein rearrangements. These observations reveal how proteins use conformational dynamics to stabilize the charge-separation steps of electron-transfer reactions.

> It has been pointed out by Patriarca et al. (2005) that the power-law tailed equilibrium distribution in heterogeneous kinetic exchange models with a distributed saving parameter can be resolved as a mixture of Gamma distributions corresponding to particular subsets of agents. Here, we propose a new four-parameter statistical distribution which is a κ-deformation of the Generalized Gamma distribution with a power-law tail, based on the deformed exponential and logarithm functions introduced by Kaniadakis (2001). We found that this new distribution is also an extension to the κ-Generalized distribution proposed by Clementi et al. (2010), with an additional shape parameter ν, and properly reproduces the whole range of the distribution of wealth in such heterogeneous kinetic exchange models. We also provide various associated statistical measures and inequality measures.
